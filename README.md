# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates fraud detection on credit card transactions using Logistic Regression in Python. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing (including concatenating two datasets due to a lack of sufficient fraud samples), model training, and evaluation, all performed in a Jupyter notebook.

## Dataset

- **Concatenation of Two Datasets:**  
  Due to the rarity of fraudulent transactions, two credit card transaction datasets were combined to increase the number of fraud samples. This helps create a more balanced and realistic dataset for training and evaluation.
- The resulting dataset contains anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`), transaction `Amount`, and a target column `Class` (1: Fraud, 0: Not Fraud).

## Why SMOTE Was Not Used

- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** is commonly used to address class imbalance by synthesizing new minority class examples.
- In this project, SMOTE was found to be not useful because:
  - The original dataset is high-dimensional and anonymized, so synthetic samples generated by SMOTE may not represent real-world fraudulent patterns and could introduce noise.
  - For fraud detection, generating artificial fraud cases can risk overfitting and reduce the modelâ€™s generalizability to real data.

## Steps Performed

1. **Import Libraries**
   - numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn modules for data handling and modeling.

2. **Load and Combine Data**
   - Both datasets are loaded using pandas and concatenated to create a single, larger DataFrame with more fraud cases.

3. **Initial Exploration**
   - Display the first few rows, check for null values, and analyze class distribution.

4. **Data Cleaning**
   - Drop the `id` column as it is not relevant for prediction.

5. **Feature Selection**
   - Features: All columns except `Class`.
   - Target: `Class`.

6. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

7. **Model Training**
   - Train a Logistic Regression model.

8. **Evaluation**
   - Predict on the test set and compute accuracy.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter notebook or Google Colab

Install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Notes

- **Why Concatenate?**  
  The concatenation of two datasets was necessary due to the limited number of fraud samples, allowing the model to learn more effectively.
- The dataset remains highly imbalanced; consider using additional metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for better evaluation.
- Further improvements could include data balancing, feature engineering, or trying advanced algorithms.
